# Expense Categories Feature

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue with JSX element usage in non-JSX context by using string-based icon types

## Overview
This PR adds a new Expense Categories visualization feature to the Centwise app. The feature allows users to view their spending categorized by type (shopping, food, transport, etc.) with interactive time period selection.

## Implementation Details

### Added Components

- Added TypeScript types and interfaces for better code quality
- Implemented module registry for scalable architecture

### Styling Changes
- Migrated `FinancialSummary` from StyleSheet to NativeWind
- Implemented new components using NativeWind exclusively
- Updated tailwind.config.js to include theme colors
- Fixed linting issues throughout the codebase

## Testing
- Tested on iOS simulator (iPhone 14 Pro)
- Verified responsive layout works on different screen sizes
- Confirmed state management correctly updates UI when changing time periods

## Screenshots
