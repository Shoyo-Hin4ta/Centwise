## New Feature: Dashboard Component

I've implemented a new Dashboard component that provides users with a visual breakdown of their expenses by category or payment method.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Interactive Expense Dashboard**
   - Visual pie chart showing expense distribution
   - Toggle between category view and payment method view
   - Time period selector (Week/Month/Year)

2. **Transaction List View**
   - Detailed transaction list when a category is selected
   - Shows transaction details including payment method and date/time

3. **Custom SVG Pie Chart**
   - Interactive segments that respond to user taps
   - Value labels for significant segments
   - Center total amount display

4. **Module-Based Architecture**
   - Used existing expenses module for category data
   - Created a new payments module for payment method data

### Implementation Notes:

- Followed the modular architecture pattern specified in the requirements
- Used NativeWind for styling
- Integrated with Zustand for state management
- Maintained consistent styling using the theme colors from colors.ts

### Next Steps:

1. **Category editing functionality**
   - Implement a modal for editing transaction categories

2. **Data persistence**
   - Connect to Supabase for storing user transactions

3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for the Dashboard component and PieChart

4. **Performance optimization**
   - Implement memoization for expensive calculations
   - Add proper loading states and skeleton screens

## How to Test:

1. Navigate to the Dashboard tab from the bottom navigation
2. Switch between Week, Month, and Year views
3. Toggle between Categories and Payment Methods using the switch
4. Tap on a segment to see transactions for that category
